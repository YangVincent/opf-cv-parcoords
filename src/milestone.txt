Final Project Milestone
  Outlier-preserving Focus+Context Visualization in Parallel Coordinates

So far, we have completed:
1. Outlier detection
2. Trend detection
3. Smoothing for clustering (required for user interaction)
4. Binning/buckets for taking advantage of frequency with normalization


Clustering is in progress as is developing the parallel coordinates system.
We originally had a parallel coordinates system in place, (still available in
this zip) but it is not optimal for letting us draw polygons to represent the
trends. As such, we are currently experimenting with using OpenGL with d3 to
allow us to draw the primary trends. If time permits, we will also add shading.

The current preprocessing is done in `bin.py`, and there are two output
files that demonstrate the outlier detection, trend detection, and clustering.
These are `normalized_trends.txt` and `outliers.txt`.

Our next steps are simply to take these files, read them into JS, and display
them with the parcoords system.
